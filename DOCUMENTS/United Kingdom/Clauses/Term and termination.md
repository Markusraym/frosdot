Customer may not terminate an Order for convenience during its Term. Each Order shall operate for the Term set out in such Order and the parties agree to automatically renew any Order in effect, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days before the expiration of the applicable current Term. Notwithstanding Section 9.2 , cancellation notifications must be emailed to {P1_Ema} and state the corresponding Order number.

Any notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances constituting the material breach.

{P1_Name} may terminate this Agreement immediately in the event that Customer or any of its affiliates begin commercially offering products and/or services that display mobile app download, revenue and/or usage trends (aside from data solely about Customer's own apps). In the event of such termination, {P1_Name}'s obligations under the Agreement will be deemed to be fully discharged .

Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, {P1_Name} will cease providing the {P1_Pro} to Customer.
